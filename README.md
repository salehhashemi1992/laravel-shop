- A sample of how to use a template in laravel using slot, components, yield, etc.
- Using of scss
- Using sweet alert system
- Sending sms with notification system and queue management system
- Using component tag system
- Using Markdown Mail system
- Split the route system
- Working with migrations and adding some new migration files
- Adding a helper php file to the composer.json
