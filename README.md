## About My Laravel Project

Laravel is my lovely favorite PHP framework, so I worked on it and add some initial features like:

- Google Authentication System
- Customized email verification after registration
- Recaptcha as a rule
- Two-factor authentication as trait
- A simple admin panel for managing users (CRUD and search system)
- A sample of how to use a template in laravel using slot, components, yield, etc.
- Simple use of scss
- Using sweet alert system
- Sending sms with notification system and queue management system
- Using component tag system
- Using Markdown Mail system
- etc

This Project is based on laravel version 8.
