## About My Laravel Project

Laravel is my lovely favorite PHP framework, so I worked on it and add some initial features like:

- Customized email verification after registration
- Recaptcha as a rule
- Two-factor authentication as trait
- Adding Admin Authorization system as a Middleware
- A simple admin panel for managing users (CRUD and search system)
- A sample of how to use a template in laravel using slot, components, yield, etc.
- Using of scss and adding Jquery to the bootstrap.js file
- Using sweet alert system
- Sending sms with notification system and queue management system
- Using component tag system
- Using Markdown Mail system
- Split the route system
- Working with migrations and adding some new migration files
- Adding a helper php file to the composer.json
- Implementing a complete ACL system to manage user roles and permissions 
- Implementing a sample of polymorphic relationships for comments

- etc

This Project is based on laravel version 8.
